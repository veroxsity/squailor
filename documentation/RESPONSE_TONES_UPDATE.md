### Data Structure
Summary metadata now includes:
```json
{
  "fileName": "example.pdf",
  "fileType": ".pdf",
  "summary": "...",
  "summaryType": "normal",
  "responseTone": "casual",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-02T13:17:00.000Z",
  "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
  ...
}
```

### Tone Mapping
Internal tone values map to display names:
