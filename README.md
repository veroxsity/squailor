- Internet connection and an OpenRouter API key
- (Optional) For best PDF thumbnails: install system dependencies for [canvas](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas)

---

## 💻 Getting Started

1. **Download** a release from [Releases](https://github.com/veroxsity/Squailor/releases), or build from source.
2. **Get an OpenRouter API key:** https://openrouter.ai/keys
3. **Launch the app → Settings → paste your API key → Save & Validate.**
4. *(Optional)* In Settings → Image Settings, adjust “Max Images per Document” to control cost and speed.
5. **Start summarizing from the Home page!**

**Build it yourself:**

```sh
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/veroxsity/Squailor.git
cd Squailor
npm install

# Run in dev
npm run start
# Windows (alternate): npm run dev

# Build installers
npm run build       # default platform
npm run build:win   # Windows
npm run build:mac   # macOS
npm run build:linux # Linux
```

> For best PDF thumbnail OCR, install canvas: `npm install canvas`
> On macOS/Linux, use `npm run start` for development. The `dev` script is Windows‑specific.

   - Stages: duplicate‑check → extraction → combining → summarizing → saving
   - Token/partial output arrives as it’s generated
- Duplicate detection
   - SHA‑256 content hash prevents reprocessing; you can overwrite or create a new copy
- Storage & history
   - Per‑document folders in data/documents
   - In‑app history list, quick preview, export to .md/.txt
- Q&A on summaries
   - Open a summary and ask follow‑up questions in the built‑in chat
   - Streaming answers with your selected model
- Secure API key storage
   - Encrypted locally in data/keystore.enc
- Auto‑updates
   - Packaged builds check GitHub Releases and can restart to install

## 🚀 Usage

1) Click “Choose Files” (PDF, PPTX, DOCX). Optionally toggle “Combine into one summary”.
2) Pick Summary Type (short/normal/longer), Style (teaching/notes), and Tone (casual/formal/informative/easy).
3) Choose an AI model. Defaults to openai/gpt‑4o‑mini (vision‑capable via OpenRouter).
4) Click Generate. Watch per‑file progress cards and streaming text.
5) Open the result, copy it, or export as Markdown/Text. Everything is saved in History.
6) Open a summary to chat with it: ask follow‑ups in the Q&A panel.

Tips

- For vision: pick a model with image support (e.g., 4o, 4o‑mini, Gemini/Haiku variants that support images).
- Control cost: lower the “Max Images per Document” setting (0–10). Fewer images = fewer tokens.
- Combined mode is capped to 3 files to keep results focused and costs predictable.

## ⚙️ Settings

Theme

- Light or Dark. Applies instantly.

AI Model

- Choose from OpenRouter models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, etc.). Vision models unlock OCR features.

Image Settings

- Max Images per Document: 0–10 (defaults to 3). Lower this to accelerate runs and reduce API spend.

Storage Location

- Switch between OS AppData and a local app folder. The app will move existing files safely.

Portable Mode

- Choose “Local app folder” in Storage to keep all data next to the executable (portable usage).

API Key

- Save & validate securely. Keys are encrypted at rest; you can delete them anytime.

App Version

- The Settings page shows the current app version, pulled from the runtime (helpful for support and reports).

Auto‑updates

- Packaged builds can check for updates under Settings → Updates. On Windows, the installer will close the main window and restart to install automatically.

## 🔒 Storage & Privacy

Where files live

- Windows: %APPDATA%/Squailor/data
- macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/Squailor/data
- Linux: ~/.config/Squailor/data

Inside data/

- documents/ — one folder per processed document (original file + summary.json)
- keystore.enc — your encrypted OpenRouter API key
- settings.json — theme, model, maxImageCount, storage location, etc.

Portable mode

- If run in a portable directory, Squailor can keep data/ next to the executable. See Settings → Storage.

Privacy

- Squailor does not collect telemetry. Your data stays on your machine.
- Only the minimal text/images needed for summarization are sent to your chosen model via OpenRouter.

## �🛠️ Troubleshooting

- “No text found”
   - Some PDFs are images only. Use a vision model and enable images; thumbnails will provide limited OCR context.
- Images didn’t affect the summary
   - Ensure the selected model supports vision. Otherwise, the app will summarize from text only.
- Rate limits / quota errors
   - These come from the model provider via OpenRouter. Try a cheaper/faster model or smaller inputs.
- Exports look odd
   - Switch to Markdown export for better formatting.

Update diagnostics

- If an update doesn’t install on Windows, check the startup log at:
  - %APPDATA%/Squailor/startup.log (packaged builds)
- You can also trigger updates manually in Settings → Updates.

—

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- Very large PDFs (50MB+) may process slowly depending on the selected model and image settings.
- On macOS/Linux development, use `npm run start` (the `dev` script sets a Windows‑style env var).
- Some scanned PDFs may require enabling images and selecting a vision‑capable model for best results.

—

## ❓ FAQ

Why is combined mode limited to 3 files?

- It keeps prompts concise and costs predictable while still capturing cross‑source insights.

Does Squailor read all images in a doc?

- It respects “Max Images per Document” and uses best‑effort extraction. PPTX/DOCX images are prioritized; PDFs use page thumbnails.

Which models support vision?

- Commonly: OpenAI 4o/4o‑mini, some Anthropic/Google models via OpenRouter. If unsupported, the app will automatically fall back to text‑only.

—

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- Smarter image selection (saliency per slide)
- Higher‑quality PDF image rendering
- More export formats (docx/pdf)
- Per‑project presets
