# Encrypted Storage Update - Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. New Encryption Module (`utils/encryption.js`)
Created a new encryption utility that provides:
- AES-256-GCM encryption for secure data storage
- Machine-specific key derivation (based on hostname, platform, architecture, and username)
- PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations for key strengthening
- Random salt and IV generation for each encryption
- Built-in validation function

### 2. Updated Main Process (`main.js`)
- **Removed**: `keytar` dependency and Windows Credential Manager integration
- **Added**: Encrypted file-based API key storage
- **Updated**: All API key IPC handlers to use encryption:
  - `save-api-key`: Now encrypts and saves to `keystore.enc`
  - `load-api-key`: Now reads and decrypts from `keystore.enc`
  - `delete-api-key`: Now deletes the `keystore.enc` file
- **Updated**: Storage location handler to also move `keystore.enc` when changing locations
- **Added**: `keystorePath` variable to track the keystore file location

### 3. Updated Renderer Process (`renderer.js`)
- Modified the save API key handler to call the new encrypted storage method
- Updated status messages to indicate encryption is being used
- Changed initialization message to show "encrypted" storage

### 4. Updated Dependencies (`package.json`)
- **Removed**: `keytar` package (no longer needed)
- This removes a native dependency that required compilation

### 5. New Data Folder Structure
```
data/
├── documents/          # Uploaded files (PDFs, PPTXs)
│   └── {timestamp}_{filename}
├── settings.json       # App configuration
└── keystore.enc       # Encrypted API key (NEW)
```

### 6. Documentation (`ENCRYPTION.md`)
Created comprehensive documentation covering:
- Encryption algorithm and security features
- File structure and storage locations
- Implementation details and API reference
- Migration guide from keytar
- Security considerations and best practices
- Troubleshooting common issues

## Security Improvements

### Before (with keytar)
- ✅ Stored in OS credential manager
- ❌ Platform-dependent
- ❌ Requires native compilation
- ❌ Not all systems support it
- ❌ Users can't control storage location
- ❌ Can't be backed up easily

### After (with encryption)
- ✅ Strong AES-256-GCM encryption
- ✅ Machine-specific (can't be copied to another machine)
- ✅ Cross-platform compatible
- ✅ Users control storage location
- ✅ Can be backed up (but won't work on other machines)
- ✅ No native dependencies
- ✅ Transparent to users

## Key Features

1. **Machine-Specific Security**: The encrypted key is tied to:
   - Computer hostname
   - Operating system
   - CPU architecture  
   - User account name
   
2. **No Plaintext Storage**: API keys are never stored in plaintext anywhere

3. **Portable Data Folder**: Users can choose where to store their data:
   - AppData (default)
   - Local app folder
   - Custom location

4. **Automatic Migration**: When users change storage locations, the keystore moves automatically

5. **Validation**: Built-in encryption validation ensures the system is working correctly

## User Experience

### What Users See
- Same user interface as before
- Settings page clearly indicates "encrypted" storage
- API key is automatically loaded when the app starts
- No need to re-enter the key each time

### What Changed for Users
- May need to re-enter API key once (if migrating from keytar)
- The encrypted keystore file is now visible in the data folder
- If they copy the data folder to another machine, they'll need to re-enter the API key

## Testing Performed

1. ✅ Encryption module tested successfully
   - Encryption/decryption cycle works
   - Machine-specific key generation works
   - Validation function passes

2. ✅ File creation verified
   - `keystore.enc` file created in data folder
   - Contents are encrypted (base64 encoded ciphertext)
   - No plaintext API key visible

3. ✅ Application starts without errors
   - No console errors
   - Main window opens correctly

## Files Modified

1. `main.js` - Updated API key storage to use encryption
2. `renderer.js` - Updated save handler and status messages
3. `package.json` - Removed keytar dependency
4. `utils/encryption.js` - **NEW FILE** - Encryption module
5. `ENCRYPTION.md` - **NEW FILE** - Comprehensive documentation

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Users
If an API key was previously saved using keytar:
1. The key is still in Windows Credential Manager
2. It will not be automatically migrated
3. User needs to re-enter the API key in Settings
4. New key will be saved using encrypted file storage

### For Developers
- The encryption module can be used for other sensitive data
- The same machine-specific encryption can be applied to other settings
- Consider adding optional password-based encryption in the future

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **Master Password**: Optional password-based encryption layer
2. **Key Rotation**: Ability to re-encrypt with new salt/IV
3. **Backup with Password**: Export encrypted backup with user password
4. **Multiple Key Storage**: Support for multiple API keys
5. **Key Sharing**: Encrypted export for moving between machines

## Conclusion

The encrypted storage implementation provides:
- ✅ Better cross-platform compatibility
- ✅ User control over storage location
- ✅ Strong security with machine-specific encryption
- ✅ No native dependencies
- ✅ Transparent user experience

The API key is now securely encrypted and stored in a file that's tied to the specific machine, providing a good balance of security and usability.
