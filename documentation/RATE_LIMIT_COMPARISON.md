### Clarity Score (1-10)

## Technical Details

### Error Detection Logic
```javascript
// Check error message content
if (error.message.includes('Rate limit')) {
  // Extract wait time
  const waitTime = match(/Please try again in ([^.]+)/)[1];
  // Return friendly message
  return `RATE_LIMIT: Wait ${waitTime}`;
}
```

### Display Logic
```javascript
// Determine icon and color based on type
if (errorType === 'rate-limit') {
  icon = '⏱️';
  color = '#f59e0b'; // Orange
  title = 'Rate Limited';
}
```

---

## User Feedback (Expected)

### Before:
> "I got an error but I don't understand what it means. Something about 429 and TPM?"

> "It says rate limit but I don't know how long to wait."

> "Why does it show my organization ID in the error?"

### After:
> "Got rate limited but it told me exactly how long to wait!"

> "The error message was actually helpful for once."

> "Orange icon made it clear it wasn't a serious problem."
