## üåü What Squailor Does

Squailor is a desktop application that reads your PDFs, PowerPoint presentations, and Word documents, then uses advanced AI models from multiple providers to generate concise, customizable summaries. Everything runs locally on your machine ‚Äî only the text extraction and AI requests are sent to your chosen provider.

### ‚ö° Core Features

- **Multi-provider AI support:** Choose from OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Cohere, Groq, Mistral, xAI, Azure OpenAI, or custom OpenAI-compatible APIs
- **Dynamic model selection:** Model list adapts based on your active provider ‚Äî see only relevant options
- **Multi-format support:** PDF, PPTX, PPT, DOCX, DOC
- **Vision OCR:** Extracts text from embedded images, charts, diagrams, and slides (when using vision-capable models)
- **Live streaming:** Watch summaries generate word-by-word in real-time
- **Customizable output:**
  - **Length:** Short (key points), Normal (balanced), or Longer (detailed)
  - **Style:** Teaching format (paragraphs & explanations) or Notes format (bullets & concise)
  - **Tone:** Casual, Formal, Informative, or ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)
- **Combined summaries:** Merge up to 3 files into one cross-referenced summary that identifies themes and resolves contradictions
- **Duplicate detection:** SHA-256 content hashing prevents reprocessing the same document
- **Q&A chat:** Ask follow-up questions about any generated summary with streaming responses
- **Per-document folders:** Each summary is stored with the original file, metadata, and preview in an organized folder structure
- **History & search:** Browse all past summaries, filter by type/tone, and quickly jump back into any document

### üîê Privacy & Security

- **Local-first:** Documents stay on your machine (stored in AppData or a portable folder you choose)
- **Encrypted API keys:** Your API keys are encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM with machine-specific encryption
- **Zero telemetry:** Squailor does not track usage or send analytics
- **Portable mode:** Run from a USB drive with all data self-contained
- **No vendor lock-in:** Switch between AI providers anytime without losing your data

### üé® Modern UI

- **Dark and light themes**
- **Multi-page workspace:** Home (process files), History (browse past work), Settings (manage keys & preferences)
- **Progress stages:** Visual feedback for duplicate check ‚Üí extract ‚Üí combine ‚Üí summarize ‚Üí save

## üîí Storage & Data

### Where Squailor Stores Your Data

By default, Squailor uses your OS-specific application data folder. You can switch to portable mode in Settings ‚Üí Storage.

**Default paths:**
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Squailor\data`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Squailor/data`
- Linux: `~/.config/Squailor/data`

**Inside the `data/` folder:**
- `documents/` ‚Äî per-document folders, each named with a short UUID:
  - `originals/` ‚Äî copy of the original uploaded file
  - `summary.json` ‚Äî generated summary, metadata, preview, and settings used
  - *(future)* `meta.json` and other versioned data
- `keystore.enc` ‚Äî your encrypted OpenRouter API key
- `settings.json` ‚Äî app settings (theme, model, image limits, storage location, etc.)

### Portable Mode

If you select "Application folder" in Settings ‚Üí Storage:
- All data moves to a `data/` folder next to the Squailor executable
- Perfect for running from a USB drive or keeping everything self-contained

### Duplicate Detection

Squailor uses SHA-256 content hashing to detect duplicate documents:
- If you try to process the same file again, Squailor will find the existing summary
- You can choose to overwrite or create a new version

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### App won't start or crashes immediately
- **Check logs:** Packaged builds write startup logs to:
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Squailor\startup.log`
- Confirm Node.js 18+ is installed (if building from source)
- Try running in dev mode: `npm run dev`

### "No text found" or empty summaries
- **PDFs with images only:** Enable "Analyze images (OCR)" and select a vision-capable model (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro)
- **Scanned documents:** May require vision models to extract text from page thumbnails
- **Large files:** Try a smaller sample first to validate setup

### Images didn't affect the summary
- Ensure the selected model supports vision ‚Äî check the model list in Settings ‚Üí AI Models
- Non-vision models will automatically fall back to text-only processing
- Increase "Max Images per Document" if you want more images analyzed (higher cost)

### Rate limit or quota errors
- These errors come from OpenRouter / your model provider
- Try a cheaper/faster model (e.g., GPT-4o Mini, Gemini 1.5 Flash)
- Reduce "Max Images per Document" to lower token usage
- Split large documents into smaller chunks

### Update doesn't install (Windows)
- Check the startup log: `%APPDATA%\Squailor\startup.log`
- The installer may require administrator privileges
- Manually download the latest release and run the installer
- Check that no other Squailor processes are running (Task Manager)

### Exports look odd or formatting is broken
- Use **Markdown export** for best formatting (preserves headings, lists, emphasis)
- TXT export is plain text only

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

- **Very large PDFs (50MB+)** may process slowly depending on the model and image settings ‚Äî try smaller files or disable image analysis
- **macOS/Linux development:** Use `npm run start` (the `dev` script sets a Windows-specific environment variable)
- **Scanned PDFs:** May require a vision-capable model and "Analyze images" enabled for best results
- **Combined mode limit:** Capped at 3 files by default to keep prompts manageable and costs predictable (configurable in Settings ‚Üí Image Settings)

---

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Why does Squailor use OpenRouter instead of direct OpenAI/Anthropic/Google APIs?**  
A: OpenRouter provides a unified API for multiple providers, allowing you to switch models easily without managing separate API keys. It also offers competitive pricing and access to a wider range of models.

**Q: Do I need to pay for OpenRouter?**  
A: OpenRouter offers a free tier with limited credits. For regular use, you'll need to add credits to your account. Pricing depends on the model you choose.

**Q: Why is combined mode limited to 3 files?**  
A: To keep prompts concise, costs predictable, and summaries focused. You can increase the limit in Settings ‚Üí Image Settings (max 10).

**Q: Does Squailor send all images in my document to the AI?**  
A: No. Squailor respects your "Max Images per Document" setting (default: 3). For PPTX/DOCX, it prioritizes embedded images. For PDFs, it extracts page thumbnails as needed.

**Q: Which models support vision/OCR?**  
A: Commonly: OpenAI GPT-4o/4o Mini, Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Google Gemini 1.5 Pro/Flash. If your selected model doesn't support vision, Squailor automatically falls back to text-only processing.

**Q: Can I run Squailor completely offline?**  
A: No. Squailor requires an internet connection to send requests to OpenRouter. Document parsing and storage are local, but AI summarization happens via API.

**Q: Is my data private?**  
A: Yes. Documents stay on your machine. Only the extracted text (and optionally, images) are sent to OpenRouter for AI processing. Squailor does not collect telemetry or store data in the cloud.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

**Near-term priorities:**
- Enhanced image selection (saliency detection for slides and charts)
- Improved PDF thumbnail rendering quality
- Additional export formats (DOCX, PDF)
- Per-project presets and custom prompts
- Unit and integration tests for parsers and encryption

**Long-term vision:**
- Workspace-level indexing and fuzzy search across all summaries
- Shared team workspaces with optional cloud sync
- Plugin system for custom parsers, exporters, and model providers
- On-device summarization for offline use (via local LLMs)

See [`documentation/SUGGESTIONS.md`](documentation/SUGGESTIONS.md) for a curated list of future enhancements and feature ideas.
